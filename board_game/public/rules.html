		<h1>Surveyors of the Galaxy</h1>

		<section>
			<h2>Introduction</h2>
			<p>Surveyors of the Galaxy is a game where players are flying spaceships in a scientific race to discover and survey the most star systems.</p>
		</section>

		<section>
			<h2>Game Set up</h2>
			<ul>
				<li>24 dots randomly drawn on the canvas each representing a star system</li>
				<li>2 symbols X, O representing each player's spaceship</li>
				<li>fuel level for each player's spaceship, starting with 12 units of fuel</li>
				<li>Home system that each player picks among all galaxies at the beginning of the game, marked with their own symbols</li>
			</ul>
		</section>

			<h2>Game Play</h2>
			<p>
				The player who didn't make the galaxy gets to go first. Before launching from their home system, she must select a destination dot by pointing to it with a pen and marking it with her symbol. Once marked you can't change your mind. YOU MAY NOT measure the distance before you select your destination. (Thus the challenge of estimating fuel use efficiently) Then she takes the ruler and draws a line from her current system (dot) to the destination system (dot) measuring how many inches. One unit of fuel is consumed per inch or inch fraction. If you overestimated the extra fuel is wasted. You MAY NOT use fractions of fuel units. If you underestimated, then you must spend another unit of fuel to compensate. For example Tiffany chooses a nearby system that she hopes is only 1 inch or less away. She marks it and draws the line. Then she measures. Unfortunately it was an 1 1/4" so she must spend 2 fuel units in order to make it. You can't choose to stop along the way unless you've not enough fuel to make the trip in which case your role in the game has ended. You may only travel to dots that have not been surveyed yet (marked with a symbol by any player). You may only travel to one new system on a turn.

				Players take turns until a player runs out of fuel. The other player may then use up her remaining fuel taking as many turns as needed. On your last turn if you do not have enough fuel to travel to the nearest system then you end the game adrift in space. (You may still win in this case.) When all players have spent all fuel then the game has ended. Count up your symbols and compare. The winner has surveyed the most systems. You must always attempt to move on to a new system each turn (you can't pass your turn). Friendly or enemy "travel lines" may be crossed and are only for reference of your previous travels (and the advanced rules for dimensional shift).

			<h2>Advanced Rules</h2>
				<h3> Events </h3>
				<p>To spice up the game you may encounter events. Each player has 6 event points to spend during a game. Each player may only spend one event point per turn. You may only use each event listed once per player per game. Keep a tab of used events next to each player's fuel count marks. You MUST decide which event to spend BEFORE selecting a destination system.</p>
				<ol>
					<li><b>POSITIVE PROPULSION</b>: The system you are leaving this turn was surrounded by a cloud of strange energy that allowed for a travel boost. When leaving this system you may travel one extra inch for free. (...but only when leaving this system. i.e. you can't save up the extra fuel...you may choose to spend no fuel and just move 1 inch or less via the boost) Draw a wiggle in your connecting line at the start of your journey to show that you used this event.</li> 

					<li><b>ASTEROID FIELD</b> : Mark an asteroid field around any unsurveyed system by drawing a dotted line circle around it. This system now requires one extra unit of fuel to enter regardless of distance.</li>

					<li><b>WORM HOLES</b> : Mark the entrance and exit to a wormhole on any 2 unsurveyed systems by drawing 4 V-shaped sun rays surrounding them. Entering and claiming this system is normal, but when you leave you MUST spend an entire turn traveling through the wormhole. You spend no fuel that turn and end your turn upon arriving at the other end, but are able to survey the other system. On the next turn after that you may leave the second system as normal. If two players have arrived at opposite ends of the wormholes on consecutive turns then the wormhole effect is canceled and they act as normal systems. If there are multiple wormholes you must continue through the chain on each consecutive turn until there are no wormholes left unexplored. You may choose the order of arrival.</li>

					<li><b>SUPER SCOPE</b> : Due to a local species with excellent technology. Before you leave this particular system you may break the rule and measure with a ruler BEFORE you move. You may ONLY measure distances from your current location to a possible destination. NEVER measure distances between other stars.</li>

					<li><b>DIMENSIONAL SHIFT</b> : Due to a confusing warp in time and space, you may- this turn only- leave from any system that you have previously traveled to (except worm holes). You must still travel only towards an un-surveyed system. Use a dotted line to mark that you used this.</li>

					<li><b>SUPERNOVA</b> : A star system goes kablooie. Choose any un-surveyd system to explode spectacularly. This system may not be surveyed nor approached. Draw scribbly squiggles on the dot to indicate as much.</li>
